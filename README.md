# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this challenge, I created an interactive map using the latest tectonic plate and earthquake GeoJSON data from github and the US geological survey website respectively. I used javascript, leaflet and the D3 library to traverse and retrieve the data. Then, I plotted the map using Mapbox.

## Map Options
 - The map has different map styles available (Street, Satellite and Dark). These can be toggled by selecting the layers option in the top right hand corner. 
 - Layers of earthquake markers and tectonic plates can also be added to the map.
 - The earthquake markers are color coded based on magnitude and show popups with information when you click on them.
 - Their sizes are proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake
 - The index on the bottom left shows the relationship between the color of the marker and the magnitude of the earthquake
